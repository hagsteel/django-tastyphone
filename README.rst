Create Objective-C code from Tasty pie schema
=======

The easiest way to get started is to look at the example.

* Every Resource that has a relationship, that allows updates, need to have blank=True
* Add libsqlite3.dylib to your xcode solution to be able to use the Sqlite credntial store


TODO!!!
-------
* Add support for authentication
* Make it format agnostic (not just json)
* Add support for ARC
